# Prometheus configuration for Actual Budget REST API
# 
# This configuration file is used to scrape metrics from the Actual Budget REST API.
# The API exposes metrics at the /v2/metrics/prometheus endpoint in Prometheus format.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to your Prometheus configuration directory
#   2. Update the target URL if your API is running on a different host/port
#   3. Restart Prometheus to load the new configuration
#
# For Docker Compose:
#   Mount this file to /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml in the Prometheus container
#   Example: ./monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
